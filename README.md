# Advent of Code 2020 
These are my solutions for the daily advent of code exercises during the december of 2020.

Check out the main website on [AdventofCode](https://adventofcode.com/) to participate yourself.

The solutions for each day can be found in each corresponding folder.

* Day 4: I was kinda stuck on the input. I did not work on hashes for quiet a while. Took me a long time to wrap my head around that exercise.

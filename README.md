# Advent of Code 2022
My goal for this year, is to reach atleast day 10 and finish the coding exercises. 

# Advent of Code 2021
It is December again and therefore the Advent of Code of 2021 has begun!

This time I decided to use this repo to host all previous years I tried to finish the Advent of Code!

# Advent of Code 2020 
These are my solutions for the daily advent of code exercises during the december of 2020.

Check out the main website on [AdventofCode](https://adventofcode.com/) to participate yourself.

The solutions for each day can be found in each corresponding folder.

* Day 4: I was kinda stuck on the input. I did not work on hashes for quiet a while. Took me a long time to wrap my head around that exercise.
